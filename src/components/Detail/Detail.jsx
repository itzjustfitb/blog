              Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its
              benefits to individuals, businesses and communities. Whether it’s
              publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or
              developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed
              to making AI accessible to everyone.

              We’re now at a pivotal moment in our AI journey. Breakthroughs in
              generative AI are fundamentally changing how people interact with
              technology — and at Google, we’ve been responsibly developing
              large language models so we can safely bring them to our products.
              Today, we’re excited to share our early progress. Developers and
              businesses can now try new APIs and products that make it easy,
              safe and scalable to start building with Google’s best AI models
              through Google Cloud and a new prototyping environment called
              MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace, we’re introducing new
              features that help people harness the power of generative AI to
              create, connect and collaborate.
